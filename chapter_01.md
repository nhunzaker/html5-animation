## Chapter 1: Basic Animation Concepts

- Animation is motion. Shape. Size. Orientation. Color...
- Time is fundamental to animation, used to express change in an object from one state to the next.
- Animation keeps us interested. If something changes, our brains naturally become curious.

### Frames and Motion

- Frames are for: storage, transmission, and display.
- Frames are a series of discrete images shown in rapid succession to simulate motion or change in an object.
- Researchers have found that at a rate of 24 frames per second, people will accept a collection of images as a single moving element.

**Programmed frames:** Less frames, use a computer to bridge the gap. This is faster to develop, but performs slower than manual methods.

**Dynamic vs static:** Are animations processed at runtime, or beforhand?
