# 5: Vectors and Animation

## Basic Motion:

* **Velocity**: Speed in a particular direction
* **Vectors**: Magnitude and direction
* **Acceleration**: A force that changes velocity

### Velocity:

* Speed in a particular direction. 
* This can be defined by pixels per frame, *however in the browser there is not a set framerate.*

### Vectors:

* Magnitude and direction. 
* Magintude is always positive
* Vectors are drawn as arrows. 

#### Vector Addition:

Used to determine the final result of two or more vectors in a system.

### Acceleration

A force that changes the velocity of an object.

Gravity is an accelerating force downward upon an object.
